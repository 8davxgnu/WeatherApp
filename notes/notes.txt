Weather Data API:

- Current planned API: AccuWeather [https://developer.accuweather.com/apis]

- API Key: 	'bMByygfch37GcLj98En47ibokp96xLXB'

- Get weather info by searching City name (?)







Ideas:
- Javascript:
    - [INTERACTABLE SLIDE BAR / "Wheel"]
        - Display current weather condition at current time w/image but allow user to 
          slide the image left/right to view the weather at past and future hours and have
          image + weather info adjust accordingly.
        - Add a button that resets the "wheel" back to current condition if not already there
